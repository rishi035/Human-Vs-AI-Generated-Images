# 🧠 Detect AI vs Human-Generated Images  

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **AI VS Human Generated Images classification Kaggle Competition**, which focused on building a machine learning model to accurately classify whether an image was generated by AI or created by a human.

As generative models become more powerful and accessible, the ability to distinguish between synthetic and real images has become crucial in areas such as media verification, security, and ethical AI. This competition aimed to promote fairness, diversity, and performance in AI content detection.

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify images as either **AI-generated** or **Human-created**.
- Ensure fairness and strong performance across a diverse dataset.
- Build a scalable and generalizable deep learning pipeline.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow Hub**
- **ResNet-50 V2** (pretrained model for transfer learning)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

## 🧠 Model Architecture

I used **ResNet-50 V2** from TensorFlow Hub, which was fine-tuned on the competition dataset.

- ✅ **Base Model:** ResNet-50 V2 with pretrained ImageNet weights
- 🔁 **Transfer Learning:** Custom classification head
- 🧼 **Preprocessing:** Image normalization, resizing (224x224), augmentation
- 📊 **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Loss curves


## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset was provided through the Kaggle competition and consists of labeled images for training and testing.

- `train.csv` - Contains image IDs and labels (`0` for human, `1` for AI-generated)
- `test.csv`  - Test set without labels for evaluation

> Note: Dataset is not included in this repo due to competition rules.

## 📈 Results

The model successfully learned to classify AI vs human-generated images using transfer learning. Further improvements are possible through data augmentation, ensembling, or use of vision transformers.

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Practical experience with image classification and transfer learning
- Hands-on use of ResNet-50 V2 for real-world applications
- Understanding model generalization, fairness, and performance tuning
